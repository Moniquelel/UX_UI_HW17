          <p class="card-text">I started out my career in the Technical Recruiting field. The first time I recruited on UX/UI designers I feel in love with the practice and through that decided to pivot into design myself. 
            First off I am a people person. Who strives to understand what makes people tick.  I enjoy creating user centric designs that solve usability issues for the business and consumers.</p>

            USER RESEARCH
            <br>
            I believe in researched backed decisions. I have conducted Guerilla testing, A/B Testing, User surveys, 
            and User acceptance testing.

            USER EMPATHY
            <br>
            To understand a user you need to understand their motivators and background. You need to lessen you biases to see from the users point of view.

            VISUAL DESIGN
            <br>
            I believe websites should not only have seemless user experiences but be aesthetically pleasing as well. There should be strong branding thorughout the site. As well as delightful experiences.
